Computer Analysis Diagnostic - Skin Cancer Classification - README
===========================

Overview
--------
This project implements a data-driven approach for CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) Classification. 
The goal is to process and analyze labeled datasets for training, validation, and testing to predict 
medical conditions or classifications. The code focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, 
and building a classification model using statistical and machine learning methods. It is designed 
to work with Google Drive, making it easy to load and access datasets directly from a mounted directory.

Datasets
--------
Ensure the following datasets are downloaded from the GitHub repository and placed in your Google Drive:
1. Training Dataset:
   - Contains labeled data for training the classification model.
2. Validation Dataset:
   - Contains labeled data for evaluating model performance during training.
3. Test Dataset:
   - Contains unlabeled data for evaluating the final model and generating predictions.

Make sure the datasets are organized in the following structure within your Google Drive:
My Drive/
└── CAD_Classification/
    ├── train/
    ├── validation/
    └── test/

Environment Setup
-----------------
To run the project, ensure you are using Google Colab or a local Python environment where Google Drive 
can be mounted. If using Colab:
1. Mount Google Drive using:
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
2. Adjust paths in the code to point to your Google Drive directory:
   DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/My Drive/CAD_Classification/'

Required Libraries
------------------
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install missing libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Code Functionality
------------------
The provided code includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading:
   - Loads the training, validation, and test datasets from Google Drive.
   - Ensures the datasets are properly formatted for analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleans and processes the data, addressing missing or inconsistent values.
   - Prepares the datasets for statistical and machine learning models.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizes trends and patterns within the dataset.
   - Examines relationships between features and their impact on the target variable.

4. Model Training:
   - Uses machine learning algorithms to build a classification model.
   - Optimizes model performance through parameter tuning and validation.

5. Evaluation and Testing:
   - Evaluates the model on the validation dataset using metrics such as accuracy or F1-score.
   - Applies the trained model to the test dataset and generates predictions.

6. Visualization:
   - Plots data distributions, feature importance, and evaluation results.

How to Run the Project
----------------------
1. Download the datasets from the GitHub repository and upload them to your Google Drive in the specified structure.
2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (FINAL_CAD_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb) in Google Colab.
3. Mount your Google Drive:
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
4. Update paths in the code to point to the dataset in your Google Drive:
   DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/My Drive/CAD_Classification/'
5. Execute the cells step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate predictions.

Expected Outputs
----------------
1. A trained machine learning model for CAD classification.
2. Metrics evaluating the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
3. Predictions for the test dataset saved as a CSV file or similar format.
